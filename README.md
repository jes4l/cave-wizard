A 2D puzzle game where a wizard is trapped in a cave guarded by skeletons. The player must strategically navigate the map, collect gems, and activate buttons that open or close doors, while managing limited energy. The wizard can respawn as a ghost that mimics previous movements and consumes energy when attacking.
